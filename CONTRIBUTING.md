# Contributing to Haicam project

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Haicam project. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [Haicam Docs](https://github.com/Haicam/Docs)? If you are a developer and have devices in your home which aren't working with Haicam yet, why not spend a couple of hours and help to integrate them?

The process is straight-forward.

 - Fork the Haicam project [git repository](https://github.com/Haicam/Haicam).
 - Write the code for your device, notification service, sensor, or IoT thing.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**develop**] branch.
